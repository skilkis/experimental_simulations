# Data Processing of Experimental Simulations

[![build][build_badge]](https://github.com/skilkis/experimental_simulations/actions/workflows/build.yml)

This repository contains the MATLAB scripts used to process the data for the
wind-tunnel simulation data gathered as part of the TU Delft master course
[AE4115] Experimental Simulations.

## Getting Started

Since the data files are too large to comfortably store on GitHub, they must be
downloaded separately. For the results of Group 33, the contents of the
group33.zip file must be extracted to a `data` folder in the repository root
directory.
